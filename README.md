## How to Run Locally

Because this project uses JavaScript ES Modules (`import` statements), you cannot simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser using the `file:///` protocol due to browser security policies (CORS).

You must serve the files from a simple local web server. The easiest way is with Python.

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/markdown-notes-app
    ```

2.  **Start a local server.** If you have Python 3, run:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    (If you have an older version of Python, you might need to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`).

3.  **Open the application** in your web browser by navigating to:
    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
